# Scraper!

Scraper is a Python script for basic web scraping.

1. Install the dependencies:
- Beautiful soup `pip install beautifulsoup4`

**Note:** You can do this globally to run the app, but you as an alternative you can create a virtual enviroment for the project using venv. The second approach is usually recommended as it won't interfere or cause dependency conficts with any other projects you run in your machine.
